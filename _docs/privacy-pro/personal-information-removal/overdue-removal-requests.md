When a record is found on a data broker site, Personal Information Removal will usually submit a removal request to the site within 24 hours. Once the request has been submitted, most sites will remove the record within 10 days, though some sites are known to take much longer. If a record has still not been removed 4 weeks after the removal request was sent, we consider it to be overdue.

The reasons for a record not being removed will vary from site to site, but some sites appear to have unreliable processes for actioning removal requests. Possible reasons for overdue removals include:

-   The removal request is still pending and will be processed eventually.
-   The removal request was ignored by the data broker.
-   The record was removed, but quickly re-added before Personal Information Removal detected the removal.

## What can I do to make sure an overdue record is removed?

When a record becomes overdue, Personal Information Removal will continue to monitor the record and check to see if it has been removed every few days. Overdue records are usually removed eventually, but in some cases the site may not honor the original removal request.

You can try submitting a removal request yourself, which sometimes will prompt sites to speed up removal. The links below will take you directly to the instructions on how to do this for each site supported by Personal Information Removal.
